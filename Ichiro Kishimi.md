This book is about the teachings of Alfred Adler, a prominent 20th century psychologist. Admittedly, I had never heard of Adlerian psychology before I laid eyes on this book. The main premise is the concept of teleology, which is the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon as opposed to a study of what caused it. The following quote summarizes this concept:<br/><br/>“People are not driven by past causes but move toward goals that they themselves set.” <br/><br/>For instance, take a mother shouting in anger towards her daughter, teleology will look at what that anger is “trying” to achieve rather than to investigate what caused it; as opposed to Freudian psychology, which studies causality. The aim is that, by understanding the “goal” of the given emotion/state of mind, it can be resolved and thus lead to a more integrated mind. In this case, the goal could be that the mother is feeling anger because she has a “goal” of overpowering her daughter into submitting.  I found this concept to be truly empowering. Once I understood it, it meant that I could be free from the past see the world not limited by whatever happened.<br/><br/>This book then builds on this concept to discuss several aspects of life, ranging from interpersonal relationships to courage and happiness. It offered a new way of looking at things. I found it to be full of wisdom and enlightening to many questions I struggle with every day.<br/><br/>If you have never heard of Adlerian psychology, or if you want to learn a few things through a Socrates-Plato style dialogue between a philosopher and youth, I recommend this book. For all the reasons stated above I give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book:<br/><br/>“Trauma does not exist.…we make out of it whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.”<br/><br/>“Loneliness is having other people and society and community around you, and having a deep sense of being excluded from them.”<br/><br/>“The courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked.”<br/><br/>“All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.”<br/><br/>“There are two objectives for behavior: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society.”<br/><br/><br/>
