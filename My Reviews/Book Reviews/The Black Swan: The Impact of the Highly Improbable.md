 Philosophers talk about two types of reasoning: deduction and induction. In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability. In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.  
  
Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty.   
  
There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling.
