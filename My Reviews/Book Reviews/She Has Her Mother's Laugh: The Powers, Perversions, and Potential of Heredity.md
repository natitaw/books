 This was a great book to read. Its full of fascinating advancements in the field of genetics. Although quite lengthy, I found it to be highly engaging and informative. The author does an excellent job explaining seemingly complex concepts in a way that I can easily understand. My mind was blown to pieces several times as I read through the different chapters. I recommend this book if you are curious about what heredity really means. Be warned though, chances are you wonâ€™t see life the same way again.
