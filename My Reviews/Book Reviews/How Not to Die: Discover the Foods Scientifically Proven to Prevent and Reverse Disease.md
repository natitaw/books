 I’ll start off by saying that if you’re an evidence-based type of guy, this book will give you all the evidence you need to eat more plants and throw away all the meat in your fridge. The first part of the book illustrates the link between the top 15 causes of premature death and meat consumption; the second part is more about the type of foods that help prevent or reverse those causes. It is well written, informative and I think everyone should read this book.   
  
BUT I have my reservations about epidemiological studies cited throughout the book. Roughly speaking, these studies look at groups of people by separating them based on their dietary habits in order to draw conclusions regarding what sort of diet leads to better (long term) health with the assumption that there is one diet that is optimal. Furthermore, these studies fail to capture the whole picture when it comes to determining the link between diet and health. Are vegetarians healthier as compared to omnivores because they eat healthy, or are they healthier because they are more health savvy as compared with the omnivores? What happens if you compare a group of vegetarians with a group of people who eat whole-food plants with high quality meat? Not sure. Also, there was no discussion evolutionary biology and its role in diet. I think the answer might be there.
