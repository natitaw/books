 ## Review
 ---
 The relationships between different states of being, such as love, courage, anger and despair, have always seemed ambiguous to me. Although this book was not about these states of being, raised my understanding of the different levels of consciousness to a new level.  
  
This book is about letting go, what it means and how it can liberate you from negative feelings. I learnt how holding on to things (resisting) is causing trouble in my life and how letting go can ameliorate unnecessary suffering. The author also talks about how these different levels consciousness affect ones relationship with others and state of well being.   
  
I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the different levels of consciousness and to those who want to liberate themselves from negative feelings.
