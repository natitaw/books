 When I read this book, I thought a lot about dichotomies. Two things are said to be dichotomous if they partition something that is whole into two parts. In order to satisfy the condition of dichotomy, these two parts must be jointly exhaustive and mutually exclusive. This means that what is partitioned is something that is whole, like for example the universe, such that the dichotomies do not exist outside of it. There are some dichotomies that are easy to understand like: good and evil, and there are some that are not so straight forward like: love and fear.   
  
This book is about what lies underneath dichotomies, how this relates to our perception of reality and how this determines how we behave in our personal reality.   
  
This book made me realize many things and gave me a new context that I can use to understand reality. Maybe it will do the same for you.
