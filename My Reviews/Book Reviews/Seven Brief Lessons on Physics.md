 This book was disappointing.   
  
Instead of the seven brief lessons as the title promises, it mostly seemed more like a sermon on how beautiful certain theories are and what a true genius is.   
  
But, here and there, it was pleasant to read, it reminded me of the authors other book '[b:Reality is Not What it Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity|29767627|Reality is Not What it Seems The Journey to Quantum Gravity|Carlo Rovelli|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463433668l/29767627.\_SY75\_.jpg|39900607]' which was much much better.
