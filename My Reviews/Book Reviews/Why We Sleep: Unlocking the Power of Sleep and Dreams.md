 Sometimes the simplest habits will take one very far. These habits, of course, must be done correctly and consistently over long periods of time. Other times, however, it is enough to know some clever tricks to stay ahead of the game. This book is about the former. It is about the most important ritual common to all mammalians and one that predates vertebrate life; the most powerful elixir of wellness and vitality known to life, the only state from which one can be infused with the deepest plentitude of being. It is about sleep.  
  
We spend one thirds of our lives in some form of sleep, which is why it is self-evident why one should learn about sleep. There is more to it than it might seem. Sleep dictates how we form new memories, forget useless ones, strengthen our immunity, keep cancer and Alzheimerâ€™s at bay, learn new language and motor skills, stabilize our emotions, and maintain optimal metabolism. This book covers it all.   
  
I was particularly intrigued by the so-called REM sleep, a stage of sleep where we enter the dream state. In this state, the rational part of our brain, the frontal cortex, is turned off allowing one to make seemingly irrational connections between events in the mind. These connections allow us to gain deep understanding that is not obvious from a rational point of view. During learning of a new language, for example, this state allows us to sort of discover underlying grammatical rules without any explicit instructions. Many revolutionary ideas that changed our world have manifested as a result of REM sleep.  
  
Due to the importance of the topic covered in the book and the fascinating way it is written, I give it 5 stars.
