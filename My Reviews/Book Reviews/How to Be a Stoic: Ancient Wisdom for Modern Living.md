 Be it Christianity, Buddhism or Atheism, it seems that we have constructed, consciously or unconsciously, a sort of personal philosophy to guide us through our lives. Perhaps this, together with our awareness of it, is what uniquely separates us from other sentient beings with which we share our planet with. This book is about one such philosophy, it is about the ancient philosophy of Stoicism.  
  
The book is organized in three parts, following the three disciplines of Stoicism. Desire – what is and is not proper to want, action – how to behave, and ascent – how to react. The author explains these pillars of Stoicism using timeless words of ancient scholars. Most importantly though, the author –himself a Stoic practitioner– draws examples from his own life to explain the meaning behind the philosophy.   
  
The book ends with practical exercises one can do in order to cultivate their character, the only thing, according to Stoicism, that is valuable under all circumstances. I have always been drawn to Stoic philosophy, I have learnt and gained many insights from this book. It will be the kind of book that I will pick up again from my shelf.
