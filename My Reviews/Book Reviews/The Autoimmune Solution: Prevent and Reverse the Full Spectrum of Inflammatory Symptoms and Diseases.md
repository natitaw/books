 Did you know that if you have an autoimmune disorder of a certain organ you would normally go to a doctor that deals with the organ and not an immunologist? Crazy.  
  
Although repetitive, I think this book hit the right balance between scientific explanation and hands-on tools. In addition, it is super easy to read which means it is available to all who might need it. I admit, the diet is very difficult. But if you have an autoimmune disease, it is well worth it.
