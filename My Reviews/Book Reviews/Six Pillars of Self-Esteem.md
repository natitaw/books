 I enjoyed reading this book. It was a perfect amalgamation of spirituality, psychology and self-development.  
  
On the first glance the concepts, the six pillars of self-esteem, appear simplistic. The magic lies in actually practicing these pillars for a prolonged period of time.   
  
As for myself, I learnt a few things that caused paradigm shifts. I realized that if I am to become a person with self-esteem, I ought to accept myself **fully** . This means also accepting parts of myself that I don't like.  
  
  
1. Live Consciously  
2. Accept Yourself  
3. Be Responsible for Yourself  
4. Assert Yourself  
5. Live Purposefully  
6. Live with Personal Integrity  
  
  
Review 2:  
Self-esteem is a kind of positive ego. An image of the self that comforts us and validates us from within; it helps us regulate our doubts and insecurities making us less dependant on others for attention and recognition. [See Law 2 from [book:The Laws of Human Nature|39330937]].  
  
Great book
