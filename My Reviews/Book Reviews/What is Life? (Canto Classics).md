 Do you know what it means to Understand?  
  
It comes from an Old English word: *understandan*. The word consists of two parts: *under* and *standan*, which means to stand.   
  
If you understand an object of thought, you stand above it i.e. you can see it through and inside out. You can manipulate its contents effortlessly and playfully.  
  
After reading this, I can say that this man, Schrödinger, appears to truly understand the scientific take on Life.  
  
Here is one of my favourite quotes form the book:  
  

>   
> So we are faced with the following remarkable situation. While the stuff from which our world picture is built is yielded exclusively from the sense organs as organs of the mind, so that every man's world picture is and always remains a construct of his mind and cannot be proved to have any other existence, *yet the conscious mind itself remains a stranger within that construct,* it has no living space in it, you can spot it nowhere in space.
