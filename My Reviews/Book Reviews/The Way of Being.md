 This is an interesting book about the relationship between a loving protective father and his deeply curious son. Through the relationship, the author goes over the questions that are important to what it means to be human: love, fear, death, freewill and reality.   
  
This book is quite broad and pleasant to read. There wasn't something radically new that I discovered while reading this book, but I can say that it shifted my perspective on some views I thought I understood well. Here is my favorite quote:  
  

>   
> We are all born into a losing struggle. There is only one permanent light that shines brightly on our shore of life. There is one permanent light that has shined since we humans became aware of our own temporary light of being. That permanent light is the light of death. On the shore, the light of death always remains lit. In life, we have the freedom to move away from the shore. We can sail in any direction our hearts desire. We can explore the oceans on the east or the oceans of the west.

  
  
All in all, I think it is a great read and I recommend it to all who are pondering upon the most important questions of life.
