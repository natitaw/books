 Things are always more than they seem.  
  

>   
> Humor here does not mean telling jokes or being comical or critisizing others and laughing at them. A genuine sense of humor is having a light touch: not beating reality into the ground but appreciating reality with a light touch. The basis of Shambhala vision is rediscovering that perfect and real sense of humor, that light touch of appreciation.
