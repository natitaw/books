 The central question that the book attempts to answer is the following: 'Have we really become more sexually liberal?'. The author attempts to answer the question by his method of genealogy.   
  
Genealogy records the history of interpretations through time. Instead of interpreting, or reinterpreting, or searching for something interpretations missed, genealogy instead takes a very zoomed out view of knowledge and discourses. It stays close to the surface of discourses and assumes no essential essences, instead it looks for strategies without strategists, discourses without single authors. Most importantly, it has a critical motive to uncover subjugated knowledgesâ€”forms of knowledge that were disqualified in history, buried underneath dominant motives.   
  
This book is very short and appears to be surface level, but there is more to it than it seems. That being said, I thought it was written in a bizarre way (maybe that's because I'm not used to reading such books), appears unnecessarily convoluted and lacks real life examples that could have been used to illustrate its points.   
  
This video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMuAa9B2y8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMuAa9B2y8)) was very helpful while I was reading the book. Check it out if you are interested.
