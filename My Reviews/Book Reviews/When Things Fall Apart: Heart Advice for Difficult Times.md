 ## Review

 I love how Pema Chödrön writes. Her words are soothing, simple, compassionate and sometimes fierce. She writes lovingly about the lessons she learnt from her teacher, Trungpa Rinpoche. The simplicity with which she writes made it very natural for me to connect with her. I never felt such a connection with other authors in similar genres before. She has a way of writing that embraces what she is communicating.   
  
  
This book was mostly about meditation and the many ways with which one can practice it. I have always struggled with meditation. But I feel that my understanding of it is better now and perhaps I can do it properly. This is because the book helped me understand what it means to meditate. To meditate, aside from sitting in a particular posture and all of that, means to be still and allow oneself to experience whatever life presents in a way that is non-judgmental and accepting. This includes those experiences that are pleasant and more importantly those that are unpleasant. Meditation is an act of courage, it is the willingness to look towards the dragon that is within. It is the ultimate commitment to your experience.

> This nonattachment has more kindness and more intimacy than that. It's actually a desire to know, like the questions of a three-year-old. We want to know our pain so we can stop endlessly running. We want to know our pleasure so we can stop endlessly grasping. Then somehow our questions get bigger and our inquisitiveness more vast. We want to know about loss so we might understand other people when their lives are falling apart. We want to know about gain so we might understand other people when they are delighted or when they get arrogant and puffed up and carried away.

> Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know. It just keeps returning with new names, forms and manifestations until we learn whatever it has to teach us about where we are separating ourselves from reality, how we are pulling back instead of opening up, closing down instead of allowing ourselves to experience fully whatever we encounter, without hesitating or retreating into ourselves.
