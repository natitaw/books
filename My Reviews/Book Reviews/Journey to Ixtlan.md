 This book was utterly fascinating and eerily bewildering at the same time. There were moments I got a glimpse of profound insights and other moments where I couldn’t follow what was going on. At times the book seemed to flow in a similar way as a strange dream, without the linearity of time. The most profound insight I had while reading was about death and the importance of remembering that it is always accompanying me:  
  
“…You, on the other hand, feel that you are immortal, and the decisions of an immortal man can be cancelled or regretted or doubted. In a world where death is the hunter, my friend, there is no time for regrets or doubts. There is only time for decisions.”  
  
Ultimately though, this book is about “stopping the world” and what that means is a mystery; this quote hints at what happens when one succeeds at “stopping the world”:  
  
“...What stopped inside you yesterday was what people have been telling you the world is like. You see, people tell us from the time we are born that the world is such and such and so and so, and naturally we have no choice but to see the world the way people have been telling us it is.”
