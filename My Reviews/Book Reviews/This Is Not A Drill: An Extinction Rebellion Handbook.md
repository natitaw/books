 ## Review
 ---
 I became curious about this XR thing when I started seeing them on the news and on my uni campus. They seem to be very motivated and courageously committed to the climate emergency.  
  
What I have understood about the XR movement after reading this book is that it is not just about climate change. Aside from the impeding climate catastrophe, they are against and want to fundamentally change the consumerist winner-takes-all never-ending-growth lifestyle. XR is about changing the power structure of the world.  
  
I am not totally convinced if their demands are achievable before its too late and it seems to me that they have a bit of cult-like nature to them. But I'm glad I read this book.
