 In case you ever wonder about how the powerhouse of a eukaryote cells (cells with a nucleus i.e. plant and animal cells) have to do with the existence of multiple sexes, respiration and biological complexity, then this book will be your gold mine.   
  
It is written well too. It blew me away many times.
