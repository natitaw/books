 This book is the most inspiring book I have ever read. It shows what a man is capable of despite mental and physical limitations. Although I wouldn’t want to define David Goggins, he seems to be a cross of CT Fletcher and Peter Attia. Having the relentlessness of one with the intelligence of the other.  
  
I was left with awe every time I finished a chapter, the first-hand accounts in this book captured the raw intensity of the authors life vividly and the amazing progression of how his mindset changed as he grew through his experiences. Experiences including three hell-weeks at the Navy SEALs and several ultra-long-distance races.  
  
 It inspired me to sign up for my first ½ marathon and open my mind about the possibilities of what I am capable of. For all the reasons above, I give it 5 stars and highly recommend the book.
