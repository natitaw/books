 ## Review
 ---
 Meditation is something that is difficult to write a book about. This is because of two reasons: on the one hand, to those who know what meditation is, such a book would be perceived as beautiful; and on the other, to those who donâ€™t, such book would only appear as kiddy.   
  
To me, it was insightful. Maybe to you it will also be insightful, maybe not.
