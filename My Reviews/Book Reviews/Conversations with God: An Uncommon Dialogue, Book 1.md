 Conversations with God, such a fascinating book. At first, I felt a little bit strange while reading it. I mean, did this guy really have a conversation with God? Like did he chat with him/her or something? How did he do that anyway?  
  
  
Great book. It showed me that there is more to God than what I had initially thought. I realize now that it is not really possible to comprehend what God is. One can only know God by being one with God.
