 This book is about how one can employ mathematics to make better sense of the world. It shows how probability theory and statistics can be used to think clearly and see events in a way that is more accurate and in conjunction with their inherent uncertainty. The book also discusses the inner workings of mathematics as to how different theories are built and how we know their veracity.  
   
Although I have always been inclined towards mathematics, this book bettered my intuition, and gave me a few new ones, with regards to the many topics discussed in the book. I give it 5 stars.
