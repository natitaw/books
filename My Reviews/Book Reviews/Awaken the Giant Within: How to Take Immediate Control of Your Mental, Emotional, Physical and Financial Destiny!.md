 ## Review
 ---
 This book reminds me of Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life. These two books have one important attribute in common and that is the personal responsibility that arises as a result of taking control of ones own destiny. The book starts with a fundamental assumption, which I 100% agree with. This assumption is that one has the power over one's life to decide and change the course of their destiny.  


  
This fundamental assumption is something you just have to believe in, especially if your life is similar to mine: you are in a position of being fortunate enough that you don't have to worry about the basic needs of life required for sustenance. Once you meet this condition, then you are 100% able to move your life in any direction you wish. This book gives you all the tools you need in order to realize where you are heading and change your direction towards whatever it is you wish to accomplish. The power lies in taking action and doing the exercises!  


  
  
##  Insights

  
  
Human behavior is motivated by two forces: pain and pleasure. A behavior is motivated either as a way to avert pain or gain pleasure. Remember that it is in your nature to do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure.   
  


  
  
  
The main message of the book can be put succinctly as follows: empower yourself!
