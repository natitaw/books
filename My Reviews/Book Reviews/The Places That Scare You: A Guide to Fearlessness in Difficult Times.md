 This book helped me better understand what meditation really is and how I could practice it.  
  
Whenever something arises in the mind (this something is usually an emotion or a thought that has emotions attached to it) I ought to accept it and be one with it using my open heart. The point is to open ones heart.

> The everyday practice is simply to develop a complete acceptance and openness to all situations and emotions, and to all people, experiencing everything totally without mental reservation and blockages, so that one never withdraws or centralizes into oneself.
