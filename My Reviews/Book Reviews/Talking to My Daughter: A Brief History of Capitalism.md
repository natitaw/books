 "So, how did these rulers manage to maintain their power, distributing surplus as the pleased, undisturbed by the majority? [...] By cultivating an ideology which caused the majority to believe deep in their hearts that only their rulers had the right to rule. This was so in Mesopotamia and it is so today. Every dominion needs a dominant ideology to legitimise it, a narrative that invokes fundamental ethical values in order to justify itself while threatening punishment for those who doubt in it."  
  
  
While almost half of humanity lives with less than 5 Euros per day, the worlds [richest](https://www.oxfam.org/en/5-shocking-facts-about-extreme-global-inequality-and-how-even-it) 1% have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people. This gives rise to two questions: one, what is the cause of such asymmetry regarding the distribution of wealth? And two, how can the 1% maintain (and grow) their wealth while simultaneously keeping the majority docile?   
  
The answer to the first question lies the way capitalism works and the way our market driven society is run. The second, has to do with a secular ideology, that accompanies capitalism, called economics. Although economics is considered to be a scientific field, it seems to lack an external objective reality with which its theories can be judged on. Take physics for example, if one proposes a theory, it can be easily verified or rejected based on an external reality that is independent on the theory or the person who came up with it. This is not the case in economics as there is no impartial test that we use to test its theories.   
  
"As market societies emerged, religion took a back seat. The birth of science that in time made the Industrial Revolution possible also gradually revealed belief in a divine order to be just that: a belief, nothing more. The ruling class needed a new narrative with which to legitimise themselves, and they drew on the same mathematical methods of physicists and engineers to prove, with theorems and equations, that market societies were the ultimate natural order, created as if by an invisible hand, to use the words of their most famous founding fatherâ€”the economist Adam Smith. This ideology, this new secular religion, was of course economics."  
  
The book was shocking, enjoyable, simple and written well. Aside from its educational factor, it was really fun to read.
