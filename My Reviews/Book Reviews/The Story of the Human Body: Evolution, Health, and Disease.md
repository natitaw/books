 Back in middle school I failed to grasp why we were being taught history, because I couldn’t see any use for it, so I asked the teacher why. He told me knowing history means knowing ourselves. Our way of life, who we are, is significantly determined by factors that is out of our direct control, and so, by examining those factors we can gain a deeper understanding of who we are. This book is about the biological history of the last surviving Homo.  
  
Shaped by the unforgiving forces of natural selection, we are now the most dominant species of the planet. The first part of the book examines exactly why that is the case. It explains why nature selected for propagating humans, primates that are jokingly weak and slow compared to other animals, into the future. What were the critical shifts that allowed us to be so? How come we are the only family, out of the genes Homo, that still exist today? What happened to our close relatives that went extinct? Why did humans evolve in the first place? The book answers these questions excitingly.   
  
It is sometimes easy to forget how amazing what the industrial and agricultural revolutions have allowed us to do. For instance, it may seem normal not to spend much time acquiring food at the supermarket, but from an evolutionary perspective it’s bizarrely novel. This is so because the time required for the body in order to adapt to a new environment is much smaller than the time between the agricultural (and industrial) revolution, that allowed for such novelty, and now. The second part of the book focuses on the problems that arise as a result of this mismatch between the body’s adaptation and the novel environment it currently inhabits. It elaborates on an interesting phenomenon, which the author calls dysevolution, that allows for the propagation of problematic mismatches, despite natural selection, from a cultural perspective. Most importantly, the book covers what we ought to do about problems that we, as individuals, are highly likely to face as a result of adaptation-environment mismatches.  
  
I found the book full of diverse interesting knowledge, engaging, well written and, in many ways, applicable. I give it 5 stars.
