 I have always been a keen follower of world news because I was always curious what was going on out there. Despite my curiosity though, I never really understood why different countries act in the way they do regarding their internal political structure and their foreign policy. This book presents a different way of seeing the world by taking countries geography into account. For me this book bridged the gap between geography and politics. I give it 4 stars not because I am an expert in world politics but because I think that it is well written and insightful.   
  
If you are curious about questions like "why is the US successful as opposed to India?" or "why are some countries in Africa rich of natural resources but remain poor?" then I think you will find some value in this book.
