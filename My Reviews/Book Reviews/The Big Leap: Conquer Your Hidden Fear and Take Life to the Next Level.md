 This book is about the Upper Limit Problem.  
  
Have you noticed that your moments of serenity are always fleeting? Have you ever had a whole day where you felt peaceful and joyous? Moments of joy seem to always be interrupted by thoughts or feelings which break the feeling of joy.   
  
This reminds me of something I read on [b:How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence|36613747|How to Change Your Mind What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence|Michael Pollan|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1545030338l/36613747.\_SY75\_.jpg|58370652]:  
  
If you imagine yourself as a snowy mountain, your thoughts would be like the ski marks. They lead you from once place to another while you move on the mountain. You see, as you age, those ski marks get deeper and deeper. This means they automatically take you from one point to another without your conscious awareness. The upper limit problem is one such deep ski mark that takes you away from your moments of joy. It acts as a sort of circuit-breaker to stop you from being joyous without limit.  
  
How do you get some fresh snow so that you can stay longer on top of your joyous mountain? This book will answer that question.  
  
Side note: I found a quote in this book that totally transformed the way I understood meditation. I want to share it here.  
  

> The art of meditation is in the way you let go of your wander-thoughts and return to the mantra.
