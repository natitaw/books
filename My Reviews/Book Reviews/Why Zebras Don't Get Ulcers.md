 Some might tell you to just stick out your chest and roll your shoulders back if you want to elevate yourself upwards in a lobster-like social hierarchy but this sentiment grossly reduces the complexity of the human psyche. One can be at the bottom of the classroom but at the same time he might happen to be the most esteemed captain of the local rugby team.   
  
If you want to find the lowest ranking human, the one that carries atypical high rates of physical and psychological stressors, look no further than the poor human â€” the true low ranking human being. Sadly, most of those who are in this position are there for no fault of their own and have to bear the consequences as though they did something wrong. Some even blame them for not having enough will to change their circumstances.
