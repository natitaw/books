 Although I found this book to be similar with [b:Transcending the Levels of Consciousness: The Stairway to Enlightenment|23319|Transcending the Levels of Consciousness The Stairway to Enlightenment|David R. Hawkins|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1377121505s/23319.jpg|24297] in many ways, the simplicity in the explanations of it allowed me to deepen my knowledge regarding the different levels of consciousness as described by Dr. Hawkins. I remain hesitant to fully accept what the author is saying, especially the latter parts of the book when he talked about higher levels of consciousness, but I think there is plenty of value to be found in the book.  
This book made me see life in a slightly different way, it made me wonder about my own level of energy (consciousness) and that of my surroundings and it gave me a context in which I can use to make sense of certain aspects of my life. Most importantly though, it showed me new doors that will perhaps help further my quest to understand meaning. For those reasons I give it 4 stars.
