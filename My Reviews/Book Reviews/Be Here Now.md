> The cosmic humour is that if you desire to move mountains and you continue to purify yourself, ultimately you will arrive at the place where you are able to move mountains. But in order to arrive at this position of power you will have had to give up being *he-who-wanted-to-move-mountains* so that you can be *he-who-put-the-mountains-there-in-the-first-place*. The humour is that finally when you have the power to move the mountain, you are the person who placed it there â€” so there the mountain stays.
