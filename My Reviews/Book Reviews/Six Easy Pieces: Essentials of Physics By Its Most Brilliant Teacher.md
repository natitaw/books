 In particle physics, there is an elementary sub-atomic particle called neutrino with zero mass. But what does it mean for a natural object to have zero mass? In order to answer this question one needs to first understand what mass is and what it abstracts.   
  
On the one hand, mass represents a property of a natural object within the context of the space-time continuum; a kind of constant that determines the strength of attraction of an object in the presence of a gravitational field (or another mass). On the other hand, we have the uncertainty principle that stipulates inherent uncertainty in the simultaneous knowledge of location and speed; and thus, if an object has zero mass it then means its location is absolutely unknown and therefore it must always be moving. Thus, if an object has zero mass then it can never be at rest.  
  
Feynman uses these kinds of questions to explain things we tend to incorrectly assume to be obvious. It is in those questions where the essential knowledge lies.
