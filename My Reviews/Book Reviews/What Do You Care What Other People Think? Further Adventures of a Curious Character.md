 Feynman is a truly wondrous character.   
  
If you are curious about the greatest physicist of all time (my opinion) I say you'd better start with [b:"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!": Adventures of a Curious Character|35167685|"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" Adventures of a Curious Character|Richard P. Feynman|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1504936953l/35167685.\_SX50\_.jpg|321174].   
  
This book is alright but the other one is much better.
