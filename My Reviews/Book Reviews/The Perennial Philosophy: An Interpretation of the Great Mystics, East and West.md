 ## Review
 ---
 The **Perennial:** that which is everlasting and continually recurring.  
  
This book is the result of Huxley's deep study on the writing of the mystics from the great traditions of the east to the enlightened Christians of the west.   
  
An anthology of mystical writing.

Nobody has yet invented a Spiritual Calculus, in terms of which we may talk coherently about the divine Ground and of the world conceived as its manifestation. For the present, therefore, we must be patient with the linguistic eccentricities of those who are compelled to describe one order of experience in terms of a symbol-system, whose relevance is to the facts of another and quite different order.

I have a special shelf in my library where I place the sacred books such as the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible or the Sutras; I shall place this book very near to it.
