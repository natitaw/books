 It has been 4 years since I first read this book for the first time. Back then the book caused a paradigm shift in the way I viewed the spiritual realm of the world. I realized that in order for one to gain spiritual—that is, something that represents a certain aspect of reality but something that is not communicable through concrete thought and language—understanding, then one needs to interpret spiritual text in a non-literal way. Growing up in a religion setting, this was not something that was, at least for me, self-evident.  
  
In this book, the author discusses who you really are. That sounds strange but if you go along with it and trust what it is saying, I think you will maybe find some truth. Let me warn you though, this is not a book where the author gives you specific evidence for every claim he makes; so, if you approach it as one, I am afraid you’ll end up being disappointed. The only way you can verify what is in it is by living it for yourself.   
  
For me, this book remains life changing.
