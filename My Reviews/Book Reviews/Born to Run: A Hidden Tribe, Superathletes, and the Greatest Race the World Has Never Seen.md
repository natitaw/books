 Ever since I started running earlier this year, I have been looking for a book that relates to what I am doing. I can’t say I’ve found it, but this one is pretty close. Although the title suggests that the book is about running, I would say it is more about an adventure—but then again, running is, seen another way, an adventure.  
  
“There's something so universal about that sensation, the way running unites our two most primal impulses: fear and pleasure. We run when we're scared, we run when we're ecstatic, we run away from our problems and run around for a good time.”
