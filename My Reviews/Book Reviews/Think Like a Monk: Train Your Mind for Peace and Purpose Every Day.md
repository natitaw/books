 ## Review
 ---
 I came across Jay Shetty during his interview at [The School of Greatness Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pmu69rdMuw). I was amazed by the snippets of wisdom he brought to the table, and so I decided to read his book.  
  
The book is about why Jay decided to become a monk, how he became one, what he learnt during the process and why he left monkhood.   
  
In the beginning, I had a bit of suspicion in my heart. I found it difficult to get past the feeling that the author was just signaling his cool spiritual experience to the rest of us and our monkey-minds.   
  
The paragraphs were simple, so simple in fact that it made feel as though I was scrolling on Instagram. But as I read on, I started to develop trust for the author and through that process I learnt a few things.   
  
Why should wisdom be presented in a complex way? Why not simplify it and make it available to more people? I think that's what Jay did in this book.  
  
I'm glad I didn't give up reading.
