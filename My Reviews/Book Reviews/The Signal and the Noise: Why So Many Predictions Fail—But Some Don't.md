 There are certain kinds of questions that all of us wrestle with. The nature of these questions is such that there is no clear way of finding an answer to them that can be undoubtedly verified. Our best, or perhaps our only, option is to use information that we have available and infer based on it the answer that is most likely to be correct. It is up to us how we interpret the information to come up with the answer. Only after the True answer is revealed, can we really know the veracity of our interpretation with which we inferred our original answer. This book is about how to best use information we have at our disposal to deduce the most likely answer.   
  
Information tends to be messy and complicated, making it easy for us to mistake the noise for a signal and incorrectly infer an answer. The book uses several examples from poker, chess, the stock market, earthquakes and terrorism to show us how one can think probabilistically in order to make the best possible forecast.   
  
I loved how the book did a very good job at explaining Bayesian reasoning. A way of thinking which leads to a high probability of capturing Truth. I found it to be written intuitively and accessible to everyone. It clarified the need for critical thinking, the importance and need for the greatest phrase in science: “I do not know”.  
  
Here’s a nice quote that in my view summarizes the main message:  
  
"If you hold there is a 100 percent probability that God exists, or a 0 percent probability, then no amount of evidence could persuade you otherwise."   
  
I give it 5 stars.
