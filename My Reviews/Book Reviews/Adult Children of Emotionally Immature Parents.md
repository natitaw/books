 ## Review
 ---
 Us mammals have a unique instinct that will enable us to calm down in the presence of external danger if we engage with others intimately. If it weren’t for this self-regulatory soothing instinct, we would be in a constant state of angst since danger tends to appear everywhere. This danger is especially evident when we are not old enough to be able to see things for what they truly are.   
  
We don’t choose who our early caregivers will be, we can only work with the cards that end up on our hands. Luckily for those who have bad hands, there are books like this one to help find a way to come out on top.  
  
This book was excellent.
