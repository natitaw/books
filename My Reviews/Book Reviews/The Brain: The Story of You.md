 There are many roads that lead toward the Truth, of which one is Neuroscience. A filed that studies the abstract innerworkings of the brain and its emergent properties in a way that is quantifiable and communicable. This book is about the brain and its biological complexity; a study about its past, present and, most importantly, its future. Written in an easy non-technical language, I found it enjoyable, exciting and filled with interesting knowledge. I give it 5 stars.
