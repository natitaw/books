 I came across the work of Siddhartha Mukherjee while reading a piece he wrote about homeostasis on The New Yorker. I was stunned by his ability of drawing a story, I looked up his name and bought his recent book The Gene. His stunning ability to tell the story of genes continued and I am happy that I decided to read the book. Siddhartha explains the history, science, and future prospects of genetics in a holistic manner. AS a person who comes from a different field, I feel like I have basic, but enough, knowledge about the principles of genetics and I am grateful for Siddhartha for writing this book.
