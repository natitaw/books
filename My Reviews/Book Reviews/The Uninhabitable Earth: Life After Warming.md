 This book is about the consequences of climate change. The author explains how climate change has already changed the balance in the ecosystem. He elaborates on different elements of chaos ensued due to the shift in ecological balance: heat, hunger, unprecedented wildfires, deadly air pollution, climate induced conflicts, plagues and precious fresh water drain. He stresses on how the poor of our world would be the ones who will be unable to cope with and thus pay most dearly.  
  
The book shows how climate change is truly alarming. Before reading it, I thought climate change was not all that bad. Now I realize how wrong I was. The book suggests that the best one can do is use their democratic voice such that climate policies are enacted.   
  
Due to the importance of the matter discussed I give it 5 stars.
