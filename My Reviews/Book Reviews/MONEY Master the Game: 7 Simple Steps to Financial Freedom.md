 Did you know that if you invest 1$ in the market with a tax-efficient environment, it will surmount to 17$ within 20 years?   
  
It seems that money is more than just a secure paper that you can use to buy bread, you can also invest it and allow it to reproduce itself. This book is about how you can do that. I am not sure if its a good book or bad, I have no way to validate what the author is saying, but I am grateful for it because it exposed me to this sort of information. Maybe it'll work for me and I'll retire at 37.
