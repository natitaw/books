 This book is about the story of autism and how our understanding of it evolved. Filled with stories of astonishing individuals on the spectrum, the book completely changed the way I view autism. It allowed me to come to a better understanding of what it really is— a gift of nature. A condition that does not arise as a result of a rare mutation that needs to be “fixed”, but something rooted in old genes shared widely with the general population; something that needs to be celebrated as part of who we are as human beings.  
  
“… instead of viewing this gift as an error of nature—a puzzle to be solved and eliminated with techniques like parental testing and selective abortion—society should regard it as a valuable part of humanity’s genetic legacy while ameliorating the aspects of autism that can be profoundly disabling without adequate forms of support…. Instead of investing millions of dollars a year to uncover the causes of autism in the future, we should be helping autistic people and their families live happier, healthier, more productive, and more secure lives in the present.”
