 ## Review

 I have read a handful of books regarding the study of mind, brain, body and their interactions. This one was unique. It was academic, well structured, comprehensive and ambitious. I can't say I understood it all, but I'm glad that I read it as it exposed me to a comprehensive way of looking at consciousness.
