 ## Review
 ---
 As an amateur athlete trying to get stronger and improve my race time, I learnt many lessons while reading this book that will undoubtedly help me advance toward my goals. Most importantly, I learnt that endurance is an attribute of the body, both physical and mental, that can be cultivated and emerges as a result of discipline, commitment and complex adaptation as a result of physical exercise.  
  
This book convincingly illustrates how an athlete can almost always push on further, much further, than he or she thinks. This is due to protective mechanisms in the brain that are there to keep us alive. This is not a book about how you can increase your endurance, however, it is full of interesting and useful information and fun to read!
