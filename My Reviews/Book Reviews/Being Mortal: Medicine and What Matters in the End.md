 ## Review
 ---
 Whilst reading this I started to understand that I will someday become frail and old. When I go to the hospital, the doctors are always optimistic about whatever problems I have, the day will eventually come when they will not be so. But my own mortality is not what concerns me, at least right now. What really worries me is the thought of my parent's becoming frail and old.   
  
Mortality is perhaps the greatest thing we all share. This book really put that into perspective.
