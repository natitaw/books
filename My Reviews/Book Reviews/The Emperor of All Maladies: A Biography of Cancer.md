 When I first saw this book, I didn’t even know what the word ‘Maladies’ meant. I wasn’t even particularly interested in cancer. The only reason I decided to read this book was because I read the authors other work—The Gene—and was moved by his writing.   
  
The word ‘malady’ originates in Old French and its meaning has to do with describing a state of being unwell. Many things can rob you of your wellness but there is one particular malady that trumps them all: Cancer. This book is the autobiography of the Emperor of all Maladies.   
  
Using intimate stories from his own experience as a cancer physician, the author narrates the story of cancer beautifully.   
  
They say one out of four of us will encounter this Emperor before our life ends. I recommend it to all that are curious.
