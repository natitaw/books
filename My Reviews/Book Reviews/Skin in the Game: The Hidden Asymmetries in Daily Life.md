 I decided to read this book because I was intrigued by the back cover. Why should we never listen to people who explain rather than do? Should you pick a surgeon who does not look like a surgeon? This book is about the necessity of bridging the gap between who you say you are and who you are, it is about having skin in the game. In addition, the book discusses the problems that will arise as a result of of not owning your risk and how this issue affects society.   
  
The author has a particular way of writing, one which I didnâ€™t understand when I started reading this book. Although he sometimes refers to me as Intellectual Yet Idiot (IYI) and tells me that I have a severe lack of understanding in probability theory, I enjoyed his style of writing. His willingness to offend shows that he is true to his words. I found great value in this book; I look forward to reading other works of the Incerto.
