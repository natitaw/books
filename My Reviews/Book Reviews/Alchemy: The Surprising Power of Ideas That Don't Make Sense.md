 ## Review
 ---
 in the physical sciences there is a direct relationship between cause and effect. In the behavioural sciences, however, such link is highly non-linear and tends to be indirect. This is especially the case if events are unfolding in real time. Once something happens, even though no one has seen it coming, it seems obvious when analysed afterwards. If you take the 2008 financial crisis as an example, no one saw it coming and afterwards everyone could see why it had happened.   
  
It is in our nature to over-rationalise events and we tend to think the future as something that's completely predictable even though uncertainty is an inherent property of the future. This book not only will help you accept this inherent uncertainty but also show you ways in which you can use such uncertainty for your benefit.
