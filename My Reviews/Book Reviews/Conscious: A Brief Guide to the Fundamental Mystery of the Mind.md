 We are very good at studying objects and relations between objects. But there is a deep mystery regarding the intrinsic properties of objects. This book is about such intrinsic property.   
  
An object is said to be conscious if there is something to be like itâ€”if it has experience. But why? And what is experience? Do inanimate objects have consciousness?  
  
This short book covers this topic in a clear, simple and enjoyable way.
