 This is a great book about leadership. The authors use their leadership experience in the navy SEALS to illustrate the lessons they learnt as to what it means to be a leader.  
  
This book promotes the idea of Extreme Ownership. Having mindset that one ought to be absolutely and completely responsible for their situation. I like this idea, I think it frees one from being a victim. But, of course, like many things in life, things are not always black and white.  
  
##### The Dichotomy of Leadership

  
###### A good leader must be:

  
- confident but not cocky;  
- courageous but not foolhardy;  
- competitive but gracious loser;  
- attentive to details but not obsessed by them;  
- strong but have endurance;  
- a leader and follower;  
- humble not passive;  
- aggressive not overbearing;  
- quiet not silent;  
- calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions;  
- close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge.  
- able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command.
