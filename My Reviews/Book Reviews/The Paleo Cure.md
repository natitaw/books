 ## Review
 ---
 This book uses knowledge from several branches of science to explain what the optimal nutrition and lifestyle is for modern humans. The premise is the following: if we structure the way we live and eat along the lines of our Palaeolithic ancestors, then we will achieve a state of well being and longevity enjoyed by our ancestors in agreement with sociological evidence.   
  
All in all, I found the book quite informative and useful.
