A personality type, as I understand it, is like a kind of abstract brain wiring. Similar to how there can only be certain geometric formations of crystals in 3D space, personality types dictate possible structures in which predefined cognitive functions get organised hierarchically resulting in a manifestation of a distinct personality type in ones character. This book does a great job at describing the different cognitive functions that make up personality types and it can be used as a great reference material.  
  
However, there is an obvious problem with the goal of nailing ones personality onto a type. Putting the correctness and legitimacy of the types aside, you proceed on the assumption that you have true self-knowledge which allows you to reflect upon your personality such that it can be identified as a type via self-assessed questionaries. Also, I am skeptical with the idea of personality types in the first place. What would be the role of culture? Religion? Socio-economic background etc?
