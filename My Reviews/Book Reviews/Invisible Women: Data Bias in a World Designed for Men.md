 This book does a good job at highlighting the ways in which societies, consciously or unconsciously, discriminate against women. It covers horrendous cruelty towards women that occur in poverty struck countries and also small nuances that might not be obvious to the average male.   
  
Aside from discussing some infuriating injustices, the book felt incredibly boring and tiresome. It's a collection of statistics in quick successions with chapters that lack a central narrative aside from citing the default male as the reason for all instances where there is no equality of outcome between the sexes. I think it is disempowering.
