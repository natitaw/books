 In this book Taleb introduces the concept of Antifragility. Although, at a first glance, you might think that antifragile is the opposite of fragile, it is not really the case. One might think of it as dichotomous rather than opposite. So just in the same way as there is positive to negative, heads to tails, up to down, love to indifference, we have fragility to antifragility.  
  
An antifragile object gains when exposed to volatility, just in the same way as a fragile object gains from stability. This concept applies to systems such as physical and biological objects. Take the body, for example, it becomes sort of ‘better’ when it’s exposed to volatility like physical exercise or caloric limitation.  
  
In this book, Taleb discusses the concept of antifragility and how it relates to our daily life. He uses examples from medicine, academics, economics, and more to make the point that we must not ignore antifragility if we want to gain from volatility and disorder, which inevitably arises as consequence of interaction with complex inter-dependent systems.  
  
  
After reading this book, I became less likely to pursue a PhD.
