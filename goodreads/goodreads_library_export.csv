Admittedly, I had never heard of Adlerian psychology before I laid eyes on this book. The main premise is the concept of teleology, which is the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon as opposed to a study of what caused it. The following quote summarizes this concept:<br/><br/>“People are not driven by past causes but move toward goals that they themselves set.” <br/><br/>For instance, take a mother shouting in anger towards her daughter, teleology will look at what that anger is “trying” to achieve rather than to investigate what caused it; as opposed to Freudian psychology, which studies causality. The aim is that, by understanding the “goal” of the given emotion/state of mind, it can be resolved and thus lead to a more integrated mind. In this case, the goal could be that the mother is feeling anger because she has a “goal” of overpowering her daughter into submitting.  I found this concept to be truly empowering. Once I understood it, it meant that I could be free from the past see the world not limited by whatever happened.<br/><br/>This book then builds on this concept to discuss several aspects of life, ranging from interpersonal relationships to courage and happiness. It offered a new way of looking at things. I found it to be full of wisdom and enlightening to many questions I struggle with every day.<br/><br/>If you have never heard of Adlerian psychology, or if you want to learn a few things through a Socrates-Plato style dialogue between a philosopher and youth, I recommend this book. For all the reasons stated above I give it 5 stars.<br/><br/>Here are some of my favorite quotes from the book:<br/><br/>“Trauma does not exist.…we make out of it whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.”<br/><br/>“Loneliness is having other people and society and community around you, and having a deep sense of being excluded from them.”<br/><br/>“The courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked.”<br/><br/>“All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.”<br/><br/>“There are two objectives for behavior: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society.”<br/><br/><br/>",,,2,,,0,,,,,

The nocebo effect will cause the subject to experience more negative effect than they would normally have.<br/><br/>This book presents the idea that our negative view of human behaviour is a result of the nocebo effect imposed upon us by popular media and news.<br/><br/>After reading this book, I made a vow (as part of my yearly vows) not to indulge myself in news again. Instead, as per the recommendation of the author, I will read 'a more nuanced Sunday paper and in-depth feature writing' instead.<br/><br/>P.S.

Axioms are ingredients with which mathematical theories are built on, these ingredients are assumed to be true without any formal proof. The following statement is an example of an axiom: if a equals b and b equals c, then a must equal c; the last part is assumed to be self-evident. A system built through the use of axioms and their logical derivations is called a formal system. <br/><br/>Put simply, Gödel's incompleteness theorem shows (via mathematical proofs) formal systems are unable to reach certain truths. In other words, formal systems are not complete. This means there are certain things that exist out there that we will never know by using formal systems; i.e., with the formal systems we have now, we will never be able to build an all knowing system. The book shows this using art, biology and music.<br/><br/>As a student of Computer Science I can say that a great deal of the content is outdated.

They lead you from once place to another while you move on the mountain. You see, as you age, those ski marks get deeper and deeper. This means they automatically take you from one point to another without your conscious awareness. The upper limit problem is one such deep ski mark that takes you away from your moments of joy. It acts as a sort of circuit-breaker to stop you from being joyous without limit.<br/><br/>How do you get some fresh snow so that you can stay longer on top of your joyous mountain? This book will answer that question.<br/><br/>Side note: I found a quote in this book that totally transformed the way I understood meditation.

Similar to how there can only be certain geometric formations of crystals in 3D space, personality types dictate possible structures in which predefined cognitive functions get organised hierarchically resulting in a manifestation of a distinct personality type in ones character. This book does a great job at describing the different cognitive functions that make up personality types and it can be used as a great reference material.<br/><br/>However, there is an obvious problem with the goal of nailing ones personality onto a type. Putting the correctness and legitimacy of the types aside, you proceed on the assumption that you have true self-knowledge which allows you to reflect upon your personality such that it can be identified as a type via self-assessed questionaries. Also, I am skeptical with the idea of personality types in the first place.  What would be the role of culture? Religion? Socio-economic background etc?",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I was amazed by the snippets of wisdom he brought to the table, and so I decided to read his book.<br/><br/>The book is about why Jay decided to become a monk, how he became one, what he learnt during the process and why he left monkhood. <br/><br/>In the beginning, I had a bit of suspicion in my heart. I found it difficult to get past the feeling that the author was just signaling his cool spiritual experience to the rest of us and our monkey-minds. <br/><br/>The paragraphs were simple, so simple in fact that it made feel as though I was scrolling on Instagram. But as I read on, I started to develop trust for the author and through that process I learnt a few things. <br/><br/>Why should wisdom be presented in a complex way? Why not simplify it and make it available to more people? I think that's what Jay did in this book.<br/><br/>I'm glad I didn't give up reading.<br/><br/><br/><blockquote><br/><i>Judgement creates an illusion: that if you see well enough to judge, then you must be better, that if someone else is failing, then you must be moving forward.</i><br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The author attempts to answer the question by his method of genealogy. <br/><br/>Genealogy records the history of interpretations through time. Instead of interpreting, or reinterpreting, or searching for something interpretations missed, genealogy instead takes a very zoomed out view of knowledge and discourses. It stays close to the surface of discourses and assumes no essential essences, instead it looks for strategies without strategists, discourses without single authors. Most importantly, it has a critical motive to uncover subjugated knowledges—forms of knowledge that were disqualified in history, buried underneath dominant motives. <br/><br/>This book is very short and appears to be surface level, but there is more to it than it seems. That being said, I thought it was written in a bizarre way (maybe that's because I'm not used to reading such books), appears unnecessarily convoluted and lacks real life examples that could have been used to illustrate its points. <br/><br/>This video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMuAa9B2y8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMuAa9B2y8)) was very helpful while I was reading the book.

[...] By cultivating an ideology which caused the majority to believe deep in their hearts that only their rulers had the right to rule. This was so in Mesopotamia and it is so today. Every dominion needs a dominant ideology to legitimise it, a narrative that invokes fundamental ethical values in order to justify itself while threatening punishment for those who doubt in it.""<br/><br/><br/>While almost half of humanity lives with less than 5 Euros per day, the worlds <a href=""https://www.oxfam.org/en/5-shocking-facts-about-extreme-global-inequality-and-how-even-it"">richest</a> 1% have more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people. This gives rise to two questions: one, what is the cause of such asymmetry regarding the distribution of wealth? And two, how can the 1% maintain (and grow) their wealth while simultaneously keeping the majority docile? <br/><br/>The answer to the first question lies the way capitalism works and the way our market driven society is run. The second, has to do with a secular ideology, that accompanies capitalism, called economics. Although economics is considered to be a scientific field, it seems to lack an external objective reality with which its theories can be judged on. Take physics for example, if one proposes a theory, it can be easily verified or rejected based on an external reality that is independent on the theory or the person who came up with it. This is not the case in economics as there is no impartial test that we use to test its theories. <br/><br/>""As market societies emerged, religion took a back seat. The birth of science that in time made the Industrial Revolution possible also gradually revealed belief in a divine order to be just that: a belief, nothing more. The ruling class needed a new narrative with which to legitimise themselves, and they drew on the same mathematical methods of physicists and engineers to prove, with theorems and equations, that market societies were the ultimate natural order, created as if by an invisible hand, to use the words of their most famous founding father—the economist Adam Smith.

In the behavioural sciences, however, such link is highly non-linear and tends to be indirect. This is especially the case if events are unfolding in real time. Once something happens, even though no one has seen it coming, it seems obvious when analysed afterwards. If you take the 2008 financial crisis as an example, no one saw it coming and afterwards everyone could see why it had happened. <br/><br/>It is in our nature to over-rationalise events and we tend to think the future as something that's completely predictable even though uncertainty is an inherent property of the future.

But what does it mean for a natural object to have zero mass? In order to answer this question one needs to first understand what mass is and what it abstracts. <br/><br/>On the one hand, mass represents a property of a natural object within the context of the space-time continuum; a kind of constant that determines the strength of attraction of an object in the presence of a gravitational field (or another mass). On the other hand, we have the uncertainty principle that stipulates inherent uncertainty in the simultaneous knowledge of location and speed; and thus, if an object has zero mass it then means its location is absolutely unknown and therefore it must always be moving. Thus, if an object has zero mass then it can never be at rest.<br/><br/>Feynman uses these kinds of questions to explain things we tend to incorrectly assume to be obvious. It is in those questions where the essential knowledge lies.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

We are born into the world completely vulnerable, defenseless and fragile. If something goes wrong at this early stage, then there will be a great price to pay. The way things look to me, its not that you must be unlucky for something to go wrong it is that you must be lucky for things to go right. <br/><br/>If you were not lucky enough to be born in a safe environment, chances are you will go through an experience that will most likely instill a lifelong imprint on your psychology and as a result dictate how you interpret the world around you. Many of us will not have leave our house in order to experience psychological trauma. Research shows that one in five Americans were sexually molested as a child, one in four get beat to the point of a mark being left on their body and one in three couples engage in physical violence. Trauma is truly everywhere.<br/><br/>When one goes through a traumatic experience, the mental faculties responsible for objectivity and emotional regulation go offline causing the subject to be stuck in a hypervigilant or numbed out state that is prepared to be assaulted at any time. It might be that the individual is completely unaware of their mental state due to complex coping mechanisms that tend to push traumatic experiences out of conscious awareness, but the body will always find a way to express the underlying condition of the psyche. Among other things, this will lead to a cascade of problems in the human organism causing mental and bodily diseases.<br/><br/>This book is about how trauma affects who we are at the core of our being and what we can do about it if we wish to change. What was most surprising for me was the interlinked relationship between the mental and the physical. When something (traumatic) happens to you and you go through an experience, your memory might forget it, but the experience will stay in your body forever as the body will always keep the score. <br/><br/><blockquote>As above, so below</blockquote><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There is one permanent light that has shined since we humans became aware of our own temporary light of being. That permanent light is the light of death. On the shore, the light of death always remains lit. In life, we have the freedom to move away from the shore. We can sail in any direction our hearts desire.

The first part of the book illustrates the link between the top 15 causes of premature death and meat consumption; the second part is more about the type of foods that help prevent or reverse those causes. It is well written, informative and I think everyone should read this book. <br/><br/>BUT I have my reservations about epidemiological studies cited throughout the book. Roughly speaking, these studies look at groups of people by separating them based on their dietary habits in order to draw conclusions regarding what sort of diet leads to better (long term) health with the assumption that there is one diet that is optimal. Furthermore, these studies fail to capture the whole picture when it comes to determining the link between diet and health. Are vegetarians healthier as compared to omnivores because they eat healthy, or are they healthier because they are more health savvy as compared with the omnivores? What happens if you compare a group of vegetarians with a group of people who eat whole-food plants with high quality meat? Not sure. Also, there was no discussion evolutionary biology and its role in diet. I think the answer might be there.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

These habits, of course, must be done correctly and consistently over long periods of time. Other times, however, it is enough to know some clever tricks to stay ahead of the game. This book is about the former. It is about the most important ritual common to all mammalians and one that predates vertebrate life; the most powerful elixir of wellness and vitality known to life, the only state from which one can be infused with the deepest plentitude of being. It is about sleep.<br/><br/>We spend one thirds of our lives in some form of sleep, which is why it is self-evident why one should learn about sleep. There is more to it than it might seem. Sleep dictates how we form new memories, forget useless ones, strengthen our immunity, keep cancer and Alzheimer’s at bay, learn new language and motor skills, stabilize our emotions, and maintain optimal metabolism. This book covers it all. <br/><br/>I was particularly intrigued by the so-called REM sleep, a stage of sleep where we enter the dream state. In this state, the rational part of our brain, the frontal cortex, is turned off allowing one to make seemingly irrational connections between events in the mind. These connections allow us to gain deep understanding that is not obvious from a rational point of view. During learning of a new language, for example, this state allows us to sort of discover underlying grammatical rules without any explicit instructions.  Many revolutionary ideas that changed our world have manifested as a result of REM sleep.<br/><br/>Due to the importance of the topic covered in the book and the fascinating way it is written, I give it 5 stars.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Also space, that too does not really exist. WHAT?!<br/><br/><br/>Do things that happen in nature require a cause in order to be properly explained? The answer to this was a resounding yes back in the days of Newton. This seems rather straightforward and our intuitions back it up. But what we are now finding out from quantum gravity  is utterly shocking, and a blow to the cause-and-effect paradigm that helps us make sense of our world. This is a book about the fundamental nature of the universe: what is reality? What is reality made out of? How does it relate with what we know? What does reality mean for our own existence? Why did the universe bang into existence? Will the universe be there forever? What is forever anyway?<br/><br/>Once someone thinks things through, then it becomes easy to understand what they are saying because they'll be able to tell you something that is condensed. The author has properly thought through the concepts that explain reality and in this book he summarizes them very well. I had no trouble understanding what he was saying up until the last chapter on Information Theory, but that's okay because he said the theory is not yet solidified. Aside from simplicity, it was also beautiful.<br/><br/><br/>It seems that the theories are pointing towards a non-dualistic structure of nature. I hope someday we'll have a grand theory that explains everything.<br/><br/><blockquote>The truth is in the depths. <br/>— Democritus</blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

One, drawn by Newton himself, and earlier espoused by Galileo and a host of other scientists over the years, was that such order was created by a divine intelligence responsible not only for the universe, but also for our own existence, and that we human beings were created in her image (and apparently other complex and beautiful beings were not!). The other conclusion is that the laws themselves are all that exist. These laws themselves require our universe to come into existence, to develop and evolve, and we are irrevocable by-product of these laws. The laws may be eternal, or they too may have come into existence, again by some yet unknown but possibly purely physical process.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Her words are soothing, simple, compassionate and sometimes fierce. She writes lovingly about the lessons she learnt from her teacher, Trungpa Rinpoche. The simplicity with which she writes made it very natural for me to connect with her. I never felt such a connection with other authors in similar genres before. She has a way of writing that embraces what she is communicating. <br/><br/><br/>This book was mostly about meditation and the many ways with which one can practice it. I have always struggled with meditation. But I feel that my understanding of it is better now and perhaps I can do it properly. This is because the book helped me understand what it means to meditate. To meditate, aside from sitting in a particular posture and all of that, means to be still and allow oneself to experience whatever life presents in a way that is non-judgmental and accepting. This includes those experiences that are pleasant and more importantly those that are unpleasant. Meditation is an act of courage, it is the willingness to look towards the dragon that is within. It is the ultimate commitment to your experience.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>This nonattachment has more kindness and more intimacy than that. It's actually a desire to know, like the questions of a three-year-old. We want to know our pain so we can stop endlessly running. We want to know our pleasure so we can stop endlessly grasping. Then somehow our questions get bigger and our inquisitiveness more vast. We want to know about loss so we might understand other people when their lives are falling apart. We want to know about gain so we might understand other people when they are delighted or when they get arrogant and puffed up and carried away.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know. It just keeps returning with new names, forms and manifestations until we learn whatever it has to teach us about where we are separating ourselves from reality, how we are pulling back instead of opening up, closing down instead of allowing ourselves to experience fully whatever we encounter, without hesitating or retreating into ourselves.<br/></blockquote><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

These two books have one important attribute in common and that is the personal responsibility that arises as a result of taking control of ones own destiny. The book starts with a fundamental assumption, which I 100% agree with. This assumption is that one has the power over one's life to decide and change the course of their destiny.<br/></p><br/><p>This fundamental assumption is something you just have to believe in, especially if your life is similar to mine: you are in a position of being fortunate enough that you don't have to worry about the basic needs of life required for sustenance. Once you meet this condition, then you are 100% able to move your life in any direction you wish. This book gives you all the tools you need in order to realize where you are heading and change your direction towards whatever it is you wish to accomplish. The power lies in taking action and doing the exercises!<br/></p><br/><br/><h2> Insights</h2><br/><p><br/>Human behavior is motivated by two forces: pain and pleasure. A behavior is motivated either as a way to avert pain or gain pleasure. Remember that it is in your nature to do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure. <br><br/>You can feel happy for no reason whatsoever. You can just decide to feel good.  <br><br/>An antidote to approval seeking is contribution.  <br><br/>Emotions are there to tell you something. Court them and listen to their message to empower yourself.<br/></p><br/><br/><p><br/>The main message of the book can be put succinctly as follows: empower yourself!<br/></p>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

And please note that these calculations are depending on inventions that have not yet been invented at scale. Inventions that are supposed to clear our atmosphere of astronomical amounts of carbon dioxide.<br/><br/>Furthermore these calculations do not include unforeseen tipping points and feedback loops, like the extremely powerful methane gas escaping from rapidly thawing Arctic permafrosts. Nor do they include already locked-in warming, hidden by air pollution, nor the aspect of equity, nor climate justice, clearly stated throughout the Paris Agreement, which is absolutely necessary to make it work on a global scale.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>If you would ask me if I believe in climate change, I would say “Yes of course! Don’t you?” But what I just realized after reading this book is that maybe it’s not something that I really believe in. I mean, is it something to ‘believe’ in the first place? It seems that climate change is a kind of measurable fact that exists in the world and something many well-learned folks that I respect agree upon. <br/><br/>So why would I not really believe in it then? Well that’s because I am not directly affected by it, or rather, I fail to see how my actions are directly linked to it. I mean, I act in a way that is mostly environmentally friendly: like I take the train, ride my bike, conserve energy when possible and I even did my bachelor thesis in a green field. But when the time comes for me to buy a plane ticket to go somewhere or when it comes to what I am going to eat tonight, the climate comes in last in terms of importance. I can see what Greta is saying but only to a certain degree, I struggle to fully understand it. I keep on finding myself directly contributing to the problem. I guess I have a lot to learn.<br/><br/>Great book.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Although, at a first glance, you might think that antifragile is the opposite of fragile, it is not really the case. One might think of it as dichotomous rather than opposite. So just in the same way as there is positive to negative, heads to tails, up to down, love to indifference, we have fragility to antifragility.<br/><br/>An antifragile object gains when exposed to volatility, just in the same way as a fragile object gains from stability. This concept applies to systems such as physical and biological objects. Take the body, for example, it becomes sort of ‘better’ when it’s exposed to volatility like physical exercise or caloric limitation.<br/><br/>In this book, Taleb discusses the concept of antifragility and how it relates to our daily life. He uses examples from medicine, academics, economics, and more to make the point that we must not ignore antifragility if we want to gain from volatility and disorder, which inevitably arises as consequence of interaction with complex inter-dependent systems.<br/><br/><br/>After reading this book, I became less likely to pursue a PhD.<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Two things are said to be dichotomous if they partition something that is whole into two parts. In order to satisfy the condition of dichotomy, these two parts must be jointly exhaustive and mutually exclusive. This means that what is partitioned is something that is whole, like for example the universe, such that the dichotomies do not exist outside of it. There are some dichotomies that are easy to understand like: good and evil, and there are some that are not so straight forward like: love and fear. <br/><br/>This book is about what lies underneath dichotomies, how this relates to our perception of reality and how this determines how we behave in our personal reality.   <br/><br/>This book made me realize many things and gave me a new context that I can use to understand reality.

It refers to a paradoxical situation wherein a donkey that is equally thirsty and hungry is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the assumption is that the ass will head towards the item that is the closest, it will inevitably die of either thirst or hunger. Such situation is a thought experiment and will never happen in real life. This is because there is an element of randomness in the thought process of the ass, pushing it in one way or another that will eventually dictate the cascade of events that will lead to water then food or the other way around. If you were able to ask the ass why it opted for one item over the other despite being equally thirsty and hungry, it will give you a rational reason to support its decision.<br/><br/>You see the problem is that we are wired to think in such a way that everything makes sense to us. This means that we are incessantly conjuring causal connections between our thoughts, it is as if we are incapable of seeing objects independent of each other. I think this is because such way of storing information is highly efficient and requires less effort. Meaning, we are almost always fooled by randomness.<br/><br/>I think the book is great.

The nature of these questions is such that there is no clear way of finding an answer to them that can be undoubtedly verified. Our best, or perhaps our only, option is to use information that we have available and infer based on it the answer that is most likely to be correct. It is up to us how we interpret the information to come up with the answer. Only after the True answer is revealed, can we really know the veracity of our interpretation with which we inferred our original answer. This book is about how to best use information we have at our disposal to deduce the most likely answer.  <br/><br/>Information tends to be messy and complicated, making it easy for us to mistake the noise for a signal and incorrectly infer an answer. The book uses several examples from poker, chess, the stock market, earthquakes and terrorism to show us how one can think probabilistically in order to make the best possible forecast. <br/><br/>I loved how the book did a very good job at explaining Bayesian reasoning. A way of thinking which leads to a high probability of capturing Truth. I found it to be written intuitively and accessible to everyone.

He told me knowing history means knowing ourselves. Our way of life, who we are, is significantly determined by factors that is out of our direct control, and so, by examining those factors we can gain a deeper understanding of who we are. This book is about the biological history of the last surviving Homo.<br/><br/>Shaped by the unforgiving forces of natural selection, we are now the most dominant species of the planet. The first part of the book examines exactly why that is the case. It explains why nature selected for propagating humans, primates that are jokingly weak and slow compared to other animals, into the future. What were the critical shifts that allowed us to be so? How come we are the only family, out of the genes Homo, that still exist today? What happened to our close relatives that went extinct? Why did humans evolve in the first place? The book answers these questions excitingly. <br/><br/>It is sometimes easy to forget how amazing what the industrial and agricultural revolutions have allowed us to do. For instance, it may seem normal not to spend much time acquiring food at the supermarket, but from an evolutionary perspective it’s bizarrely novel. This is so because the time required for the body in order to adapt to a new environment is much smaller than the time between the agricultural (and industrial) revolution, that allowed for such novelty, and now. The second part of the book focuses on the problems that arise as a result of this mismatch between the body’s adaptation and the novel environment it currently inhabits. It elaborates on an interesting phenomenon, which the author calls dysevolution, that allows for the propagation of problematic mismatches, despite natural selection, from a cultural perspective. Most importantly, the book covers what we ought to do about problems that we, as individuals, are highly likely to face as a result of adaptation-environment mismatches.<br/><br/>I found the book full of diverse interesting knowledge, engaging, well written and, in many ways, applicable.

Filled with stories of astonishing individuals on the spectrum, the book completely changed the way I view autism. It allowed me to come to a better understanding of what it really is— a gift of nature. A condition that does not arise as a result of a rare mutation that needs to be “fixed”, but something rooted in old genes shared widely with the general population; something that needs to be celebrated as part of who we are as human beings.<br/><br/>“… instead of viewing this gift as an error of nature—a puzzle to be solved and eliminated with techniques like parental testing and selective abortion—society should regard it as a valuable part of humanity’s genetic legacy while ameliorating the aspects of autism that can be profoundly disabling without adequate forms of support…. Instead of investing millions of dollars a year to uncover the causes of autism in the future, we should be helping autistic people and their families live happier, healthier, more productive, and more secure lives in the present.”<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Perhaps this, together with our awareness of it, is what uniquely separates us from other sentient beings with which we share our planet with. This book is about one such philosophy, it is about the ancient philosophy of Stoicism.<br/><br/>The book is organized in three parts, following the three disciplines of Stoicism. Desire – what is and is not proper to want, action – how to behave, and ascent – how to react. The author explains these pillars of Stoicism using timeless words of ancient scholars. Most importantly though, the author –himself a Stoic practitioner– draws examples from his own life to explain the meaning behind the philosophy. <br/><br/>The book ends with practical exercises one can do in order to cultivate their character, the only thing, according to Stoicism, that is valuable under all circumstances. I have always been drawn to Stoic philosophy, I have learnt and gained many insights from this book. It will be the kind of book that I will pick up again from my shelf.<br/>",,,2,,,0,,,,,

In addition, the book discusses the problems that will arise as a result of of not owning your risk and how this issue affects society. <br/><br/>The author has a particular way of writing, one which I didn’t understand when I started reading this book. Although he sometimes refers to me as Intellectual Yet Idiot (IYI) and tells me that I have a severe lack of understanding in probability theory, I enjoyed his style of writing.

Back then the book caused a paradigm shift in the way I viewed the spiritual realm of the world. I realized that in order for one to gain spiritual—that is, something that represents a certain aspect of reality but something that is not communicable through concrete thought and language—understanding, then one needs to interpret spiritual text in a non-literal way. Growing up in a religion setting, this was not something that was, at least for me, self-evident.<br/><br/>In this book, the author discusses who you really are. That sounds strange but if you go along with it and trust what it is saying, I think you will maybe find some truth. Let me warn you though, this is not a book where the author gives you specific evidence for every claim he makes; so, if you approach it as one, I am afraid you’ll end up being disappointed.

In deductive reasoning the move from premises to conclusions is such that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In inductive reasoning, on the other hand, the conclusion follows from the premises not with necessity but only with probability.  In a nutshell, this book is about the consequences confusing inductive reasoning for deductive reasoning and why the confusion occurs in the first place.<br/><br/>Taleb states that probability is the mother of all abstractions. This is so because probability is a mode of thought/reasoning that attempts to capture uncertainty. Abstraction is sort of the construction of a mental model that represents reality in a general sense, such act requires a certain “amount”, or rather, “energy”. The mother abstraction, thus, being at the infinite limit, requires infinite cognitive energy. Hence, this particular abstraction is truly incomprehensible. To me this makes better sense when looked at via an example. Autistic individuals are not able to understand other’s emotions because they lack whatever is necessary to do that. This means such understanding is outside their mental scope, it’s something like sympathy-empathy abstraction that represents whatever allows this understanding. It is somewhat self-evident why said abstraction will not be comprehensible to these individuals. Somewhat similarly, all individuals are not able to comprehend uncertainty. <br/><br/>There are two things needed in order for one to enjoy this book: curiosity and the ability to put aside, or rather be entertained by, the authors need to bash on academics and people associated with banks. I think it is beautifully written, insightful and humbling.<br/>",,,1,those who want to wrestle with uncertainty,,0,,,,,

The author explains how climate change has already changed the balance in the ecosystem. He elaborates on different elements of chaos ensued due to the shift in ecological balance: heat, hunger, unprecedented wildfires, deadly air pollution, climate induced conflicts, plagues and precious fresh water drain. He stresses on how the poor of our world would be the ones who will be unable to cope with and thus pay most dearly.<br/><br/>The book shows how climate change is truly alarming. Before reading it, I thought climate change was not all that bad. Now I realize how wrong I was. The book suggests that the best one can do is use their democratic voice such that climate policies are enacted. <br/><br/>Due to the importance of the matter discussed I give it 5 stars.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
